## Title : Coding Challenge: High-Performance Microservices in Java**

** Altimetrik Coding Challenge Assignment: Senior Engineer - Product and Platform Engineering **

**Description :** Design a coding challenge that assesses the candidate's proficiency in developing high- performance microservices in Java, utilizing a range of technologies and best practices. The challenge should focus on building scalable and efficient microservices architecture with multi-threading capabilities, integrated with AWS services, and emphasizing CI/CD principles for automated testing and deployment. Candidates should demonstrate their expertise in Java 11, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, and other related technologies.

**Duration of the Interview :** 2 hours

**Subtasks:**

**Backend Requirements**

- Create a set of microservices in Java using Spring Boot framework. Implement REST APIs for the microservices to interact with each other.
  - Example: Implement a user service and an order service that communicate with each other through REST APIs.
    - Tools: Java 11, Spring Boot, REST API, Postman

**Backend Requirements**

- Implement multi-threading functionalities within the microservices to handle concurrent requests efficiently and optimize performance.
  - Example: Use Java Executors framework to manage multiple threads in the microservices.
    - Tools: Java 11, Multithreading, Executors framework

**Backend Requirements**

- Set up the microservices deployment on AWS using Docker containers, ECS, or EKS. Configure SQS and SNS for event-driven communication between the services.
  - Example: Deploy the microservices on ECS cluster and configure SNS to notify users about order updates.
    - Tools: AWS, Docker, ECS, EKS, SQS, SNS
