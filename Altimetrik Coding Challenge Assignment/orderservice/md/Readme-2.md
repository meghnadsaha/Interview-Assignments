To deploy your microservices with MongoDB on AWS using Docker containers and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Dockerize Your Microservices and MongoDB

Create Dockerfiles for each of your microservices and MongoDB. Here's a basic example for a Spring Boot microservice:

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile for your Spring Boot microservice
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
COPY target/your-service.jar /app/
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-service.jar"]
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Images and Push to Amazon ECR

Build your Docker images and push them to Amazon ECR. You'll also need to push your MongoDB image to ECR.

### Step 3: Set Up Your EKS Cluster

Go to the Amazon EKS console and create a new EKS cluster or use an existing one. Make sure to note down the cluster name and region.

### Step 4: Configure kubectl

Configure `kubectl` to connect to your EKS cluster. You can do this using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws eks --region <your-region> update-kubeconfig --name <your-cluster-name>
```

### Step 5: Deploy MongoDB to EKS

Create a StatefulSet and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) YAML file for MongoDB. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongodb
spec:
  serviceName: mongodb
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mongodb
          image: <your-mongodb-image>
          ports:
            - containerPort: 27017
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mongodb-data
              mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: mongodb-data
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 10Gi
```

Apply the MongoDB StatefulSet and PVC YAML files using `kubectl apply -f <filename>`.

### Step 6: Deploy Microservices to EKS

Create Kubernetes deployment YAML files for each microservice. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: your-service
          image: <your-service-image>
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

Apply the deployment YAML files using `kubectl apply -f <filename>`.

### Step 7: Expose Services

Expose your microservices as Kubernetes services using Service YAML files. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: your-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: your-service
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply the service YAML files using `kubectl apply -f <filename>`.

### Step 8: Test and Monitor

Test your microservices deployment to ensure everything is working as expected. Monitor the performance and health of your services using tools like CloudWatch or Prometheus.

Please note that these are basic examples, and you may need to adjust the configuration based on your specific requirements and environment. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary IAM roles, security groups, and networking configurations set up to allow communication between your EKS cluster, MongoDB, and other AWS services.
