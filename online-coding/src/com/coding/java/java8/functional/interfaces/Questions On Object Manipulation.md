Here's a list of 100 coding questions involving functional interfaces and a list of employee objects. These questions cover various operations such as filtering, mapping, sorting, and more. Each question is followed by a brief description of the task to be accomplished.

1. Filter employees above a certain age threshold.
   To filter employees above a certain age threshold using functional interfaces in Java, you can use the `Predicate` functional interface. Here's an example:

```java


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
        employees.add(new Employee("Alice", 25));
        employees.add(new Employee("Bob", 30));
        employees.add(new Employee("Charlie", 35));
        employees.add(new Employee("David", 40));
        
        int ageThreshold = 30;
        
        Predicate<Employee> aboveAgeThreshold = employee -> employee.getAge() > ageThreshold;
        
        List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
                .filter(aboveAgeThreshold)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        
        filteredEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```



2. Filter employees with a salary above a certain amount.
   To filter employees with a salary above a certain amount using functional interfaces in Java, you can use the `Predicate` functional interface. Here's an example:

```java

class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    
    public Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
        employees.add(new Employee("Alice", 30000));
        employees.add(new Employee("Bob", 40000));
        employees.add(new Employee("Charlie", 50000));
        employees.add(new Employee("David", 60000));
        
        double salaryThreshold = 45000;
        
        Predicate<Employee> aboveSalaryThreshold = employee -> employee.getSalary() > salaryThreshold;
        
        List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
                .filter(aboveSalaryThreshold)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        
        filteredEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
Here are the solutions to the remaining questions using functional interfaces in Java:

3. Filter employees whose names start with a specific letter:

```java
Predicate<Employee> startsWithLetter = employee -> employee.getName().startsWith("A");
List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
        .filter(startsWithLetter)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

4. Filter employees who joined the company after a specific date:

```java
Predicate<Employee> joinedAfterDate = employee -> employee.getJoinDate().isAfter(LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1));
List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
        .filter(joinedAfterDate)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

5. Filter employees who are managers:

```java
Predicate<Employee> isManager = Employee::isManager;
List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
        .filter(isManager)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

6. Filter employees who are not managers:

```java
Predicate<Employee> isNotManager = employee -> !employee.isManager();
List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
        .filter(isNotManager)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

7. Filter employees based on multiple criteria (e.g., age and salary):

```java
Predicate<Employee> filterCriteria = employee -> employee.getAge() > 30 && employee.getSalary() > 50000;
List<Employee> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
        .filter(filterCriteria)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

8. Map employee names to uppercase:

```java
Function<Employee, String> toUpperCase = employee -> employee.getName().toUpperCase();
List<String> upperCaseNames = employees.stream()
        .map(toUpperCase)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

9. Map employee names to lowercase:

```java
Function<Employee, String> toLowerCase = employee -> employee.getName().toLowerCase();
List<String> lowerCaseNames = employees.stream()
        .map(toLowerCase)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

10. Map employee names to their lengths:

```java
Function<Employee, Integer> nameLength = employee -> employee.getName().length();
List<Integer> nameLengths = employees.stream()
        .map(nameLength)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

11. Map employee ages to a different range (e.g., 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, etc.):

```java
Function<Employee, String> ageRange = employee -> {
    int age = employee.getAge();
    if (age >= 18 && age <= 30) {
        return "18-30";
    } else if (age >= 31 && age <= 40) {
        return "31-40";
    } else if (age >= 41 && age <= 50) {
        return "41-50";
    } else {
        return "50+";
    }
};
List<String> ageRanges = employees.stream()
        .map(ageRange)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

12. Map employee salaries to a different currency:

```java
Function<Employee, Double> convertToDifferentCurrency = employee -> employee.getSalary() * 0.75; // Assuming a conversion rate of 0.75
List<Double> convertedSalaries = employees.stream()
        .map(convertToDifferentCurrency)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

13. Sort employees by name in ascending order:

```java
Comparator<Employee> byNameAscending = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName);
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employees.stream()
        .sorted(byNameAscending)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

14. Sort employees by name in descending order:

```java
Comparator<Employee> byNameDescending = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName).reversed();
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employees.stream()
        .sorted(byNameDescending)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

15. Sort employees by age in ascending order:

```java
Comparator<Employee> byAgeAscending = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge);
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employees.stream()
        .sorted(byAgeAscending)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

16. Sort employees by age in descending order:

```java
Comparator<Employee> byAgeDescending = Comparator.comparingInt(Employee::getAge).reversed();
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employees.stream()
        .sorted(byAgeDescending)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

17. Sort employees by salary in ascending order:

```java
Comparator<Employee> bySalaryAscending = Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary);
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employees.stream()
        .sorted(bySalaryAscending)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

18. Sort employees by salary in descending order:

```java
Comparator<Employee> bySalaryDescending = Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary).reversed();
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = employees.stream()
        .sorted(bySalaryDescending)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

19. Find the average age of all employees:

```java
double averageAge = employees.stream()
        .mapToDouble(Employee::getAge)
        .average()
        .orElse(0);
```

Here are the solutions to the additional questions using functional interfaces in Java:

```java
long totalEmployees = employees.stream()
        .count();
```

22. Find the highest salary among all employees:

Note: Ensure the `Employee` class has appropriate getters for `name`, `age`, `salary`, and `joinDate`, and a `isManager` method if not already implemented.

52. Remove duplicates based on the 'jav8' field
    Another way to remove duplicate objects from a list based on a specific field without overriding `hashCode` and `equals` is to use a stream and collect the elements into a `Map` where the key is the field you want to use for uniqueness. Then, you can extract the values from the map to get the unique elements. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
    static class Employee {
        private int id;
        private String name;
        private String jav8;

        public Employee(int id, String name, String jav8) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            this.jav8 = jav8;
        }}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
                new Employee(1, "Alice", "jav8"),
                new Employee(2, "Bob", "jav8"),
                new Employee(3, "Charlie", "jav8"),
                new Employee(4, "David", "jav8"),
                new Employee(5, "Alice", "jav8"),
                new Employee(6, "Bob", "jav8")
        );

        // Remove duplicates based on the 'jav8' field
       /**
        * This part of the code is using the `Collectors.toMap` collector to collect elements into a map. Let's break down the parameters:

        - `Employee::getJav8`: This is the key mapper function. It extracts the `jav8` field value from each `Employee` object, which will be used as the key in the map.

        - `e -> e`: This is the value mapper function. It specifies that the value in the map should be the `Employee` object itself.

        - `(e1, e2) -> e1`: This is the merge function. It specifies that if two `Employee` objects have the same key (i.e., the same `jav8` value), the value from the first `Employee` encountered (`e1`) should be retained.

        So, overall, this collector collects elements into a map where the key is the `jav8` field value and the value is the `Employee` object itself. If duplicate keys are encountered, it retains the `Employee` object from the first occurrence.
        */
        List<Employee> uniqueEmployees = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(Employee::getJav8, e -> e, (e1, e2) -> e1))
                .values().stream()
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        uniqueEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(employee.getName() + " - " + employee.getJav8()));
    }
}
```
Alternative
```java

// Remove duplicates based on the 'jav8' field
        List<Employee> uniqueEmployees = employees.stream()
        .filter(distinctByKey(Employee::getJav8))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

        uniqueEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(employee.getName() + " - " + employee.getJav8()));

public static <T> java.util.function.Predicate<T> distinctByKey(Function<? super T, ?> keyExtractor) {
        Map<Object, Boolean> seen = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        return t -> seen.putIfAbsent(keyExtractor.apply(t), Boolean.TRUE) == null;
    }
```
Alternative

```java

// Remove duplicates based on the 'jav8' field
        List<Employee> uniqueEmployees = removeDuplicates(employees, Employee::getJav8);

        uniqueEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(employee.getName() + " - " + employee.getJav8()));
    

    public static <T> List<T> removeDuplicates(List<T> list, Function<T, ?> keyExtractor) {
        Set<Object> seen = new HashSet<>();
        return list.stream()
                .filter(e -> seen.add(keyExtractor.apply(e)))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
```
Alternative

```java
// Remove duplicates based on the 'jav8' field
        List<Employee> uniqueEmployees = new ArrayList<>(new LinkedHashSet<>(employees.stream()
                .map(Employee::getJav8)
                .collect(Collectors.toList()))
                .stream()
                .map(jav8 -> employees.stream()
                        .filter(employee -> employee.getJav8().equals(jav8))
                        .findFirst()
                        .orElse(null))
                .collect(Collectors.toList()));

        uniqueEmployees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(employee.getName() + " - " + employee.getJav8()));
 
```

In this example, the `employees` list is converted into a stream. Then, the `Collectors.toMap` collector is used to collect the elements into a map where the key is the `jav8` field and the value is the `Employee` object itself. If duplicate keys are encountered, the third argument to `toMap` (`(e1, e2) -> e1`) specifies that the first value should be retained. Finally, the `values()` method is used to extract the values from the map, resulting in a collection of unique `Employee` objects.

```java
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

                new Employee("Eve", 120000)
        );

        char specificLetter = 'C';

        Optional<Employee> employeeWithHighestSalary = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getName().charAt(0) == specificLetter)
                .max(Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary));
                    

        employeeWithHighestSalary.ifPresent(employee ->
                System.out.println("Employee with highest salary whose name starts with " + specificLetter + ": " + employee.getName() + ", Salary: " + employee.getSalary()));
    }

    static class Employee {
        private final String name;
        private final double salary;
    }
}
```

String specificSubstring = "li";

        double averageSalary = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> !employee.getName().toLowerCase().contains(specificSubstring.toLowerCase()))
                .mapToDouble(Employee::getSalary)
                .average()
                .orElse(0.0); // Default value if no employees match the criteria

        System.out.println("Average salary of employees whose names do not contain '" + specificSubstring + "': " + averageSalary);

```
55. Find the total number of employees who joined the company after a specific date and are managers.


These are complex queries that involve filtering, grouping, and aggregating data from a list of employee objects. Implementing these queries using functional interfaces would require careful design and could involve multiple steps. Here's a simplified example for one of the queries to give you an idea of how you might approach them:

```java


        // Example: Find the total number of employees who joined the company after a specific date and are managers
        LocalDate specificDate = LocalDate.of(2019, 1, 1);
        long count = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getJoinDate().isAfter(specificDate) && employee.isManager())
                .count();

        System.out.println("Total number of employees who joined after " + specificDate + " and are managers: " + count);
    

    static class Employee {
        private final String name;
        private final int age;
        private final double salary;
        private final boolean isManager;
        private final LocalDate joinDate;
    }
}
```
```java
// Populate employees list

        // 56. Find the total number of employees who joined the company before a specific date and are not managers.
        LocalDate specificDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1);
        long count = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getJoinDate().isBefore(specificDate))
                .filter(employee -> !employee.isManager())
                .count();
        System.out.println("Total number of employees who joined before " + specificDate + " and are not managers: " + count);

        // 57. Find the employee with the highest salary among employees with a specific age.
        int specificAge = 30;
        Optional<Employee> highestSalaryEmployee = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getAge() == specificAge)
                .max((e1, e2) -> e1.getSalary().compareTo(e2.getSalary()));
        highestSalaryEmployee.ifPresent(employee -> System.out.println("Employee with the highest salary at age " + specificAge + ": " + employee.getName()));

        // 58. Find the employee with the lowest salary among employees with a specific age.
        Optional<Employee> lowestSalaryEmployee = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getAge() == specificAge)
                .min((e1, e2) -> e1.getSalary().compareTo(e2.getSalary()));
        lowestSalaryEmployee.ifPresent(employee -> System.out.println("Employee with the lowest salary at age " + specificAge + ": " + employee.getName()));

        // 59. Find the average salary of employees with names of a specific length.
        int specificNameLength = 5;
        OptionalDouble averageSalary = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getName().length() == specificNameLength)
                .mapToDouble(employee -> employee.getSalary().doubleValue())
                .average();
        averageSalary.ifPresent(avg -> System.out.println("Average salary of employees with name length " + specificNameLength + ": " + avg));
  
```
Here's how you can implement these queries using functional interfaces in Java:

```java


class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private BigDecimal salary;
    private LocalDate joinDate;
    private boolean isManager;

    // Constructor, getters, setters...
}

public class EmployeeQueries {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

        // Populate employees list

        // 60. Find the total number of employees whose salaries are multiples of a specific number.
        BigDecimal specificMultiple = new BigDecimal(1000);
        long multipleCount = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getSalary().remainder(specificMultiple).compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) == 0)
                .count();
        System.out.println("Total number of employees whose salaries are multiples of " + specificMultiple + ": " + multipleCount);

       
        // Add more queries as needed
    }
}
```
61.Find the employee with the highest salary among employees whose names have a specific length.

```java
        int specificNameLength = 5;
        Optional<Employee> highestSalaryEmployeeWithNameLength = employees.stream()
                .filter(employee -> employee.getName().length() == specificNameLength)
                .max((e1, e2) -> e1.getSalary().compareTo(e2.getSalary()));
        highestSalaryEmployeeWithNameLength.ifPresent(employee -> System.out.println("Employee with the highest salary and name length " + specificNameLength + ": " + employee.getName()));
```
62. Find the employee with the lowest salary among employees whose names do not contain a specific substring.

```java
        String specificSubstring = "John";
