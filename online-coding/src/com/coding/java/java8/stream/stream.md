Here are some coding questions related to employee list manipulation with a return type of `Map`:

```java
class Employee {
    
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private int age;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String name, String department, int age, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            List<Employee> employees = List.of(
                    new Employee("Alice", "HR", 25, 50000),
                    new Employee("Bob", "IT", 30, 60000),
                    new Employee("Charlie", "HR", 35, 70000),
                    new Employee("David", "IT", 40, 80000),
                    new Employee("Eve", "HR", 45, 90000)
            );
        }
}
```

1. **Filter Employees by Age Range and Return Map:** 
```java
        int minAge = 30;
        int maxAge = 40;

        Map<String, Integer> filteredEmployees = employees.stream()
                .filter(e -> e.getAge() >= minAge && e.getAge() <= maxAge)
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(Employee::getName, Employee::getAge));

        System.out.println(filteredEmployees);
```
2. **Group Employees by Department and Return Map:**
```java
  Map<String, List<Employee>> employeesByDepartment = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment));

        System.out.println("Employees by Department:");
        System.out.println(employeesByDepartment);
```
3. **Find Average Salary by Department and Return Map:** 
```java
Map<String, Double> averageSalaryByDepartment = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                        Collectors.averagingDouble(Employee::getSalary)));

        System.out.println("\nAverage Salary by Department:");
        System.out.println(averageSalaryByDepartment);

```
4. **Find Highest Paid Employee in Each Department and Return Map:**
```java
Map<String, Optional<Employee>> highestPaidEmployeeByDepartment = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                        Collectors.maxBy(Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary))));

        System.out.println("\nHighest Paid Employee by Department:");
        System.out.println(highestPaidEmployeeByDepartment);

```
5. **Find Total Salary Expense by Department and Return Map:**
```java
Map<String, Double> totalSalaryExpenseByDepartment = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                        Collectors.summingDouble(Employee::getSalary)));

        System.out.println("\nTotal Salary Expense by Department:");
        System.out.println(totalSalaryExpenseByDepartment);
```
6. **Group Employees by Age and Return Map:**
```java
Map<Integer, List<Employee>> employeesByAge = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getAge));

        System.out.println("\nEmployees by Age:");
        System.out.println(employeesByAge);
```
7. **Find Employee with Longest Name in Each Department and Return Map:** 
```java
 Map<String, Optional<Employee>> employeeWithLongestNameByDepartment = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                        Collectors.maxBy(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.getName().length()))));

        System.out.println("\nEmployee with Longest Name by Department:");
        System.out.println(employeeWithLongestNameByDepartment);
```
8. **Find Average Age of Employees by Department and Return Map:**
```java
 Map<String, Double> averageAgeByDepartment = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment,
                        Collectors.averagingDouble(Employee::getAge)));

        System.out.println("\nAverage Age by Department:");
        System.out.println(averageAgeByDepartment);
```
9. **Find duplicate employees based on name**

```java
Map<String, Long> nameCountMap = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getName, Collectors.counting()));

        List<Employee> duplicateEmployees = employees.stream()
                .filter(e -> nameCountMap.get(e.getName()) > 1)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println("Duplicate Employees:");
        duplicateEmployees.forEach(System.out::println);
```

Alternative
```java
 Map<String, List<Employee>> duplicateEmployeesMap = findDuplicateEmployeesByName(employees);

        System.out.println("Duplicate Employees:");
        duplicateEmployeesMap.forEach((name, duplicates) -> {
            System.out.println("Name: " + name);
            duplicates.forEach(System.out::println);
        });
    

    public static Map<String, List<Employee>> findDuplicateEmployeesByName(List<Employee> employees) {
        Map<String, Long> nameCountMap = employees.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getName, Collectors.counting()));

        return employees.stream()
                .filter(e -> nameCountMap.get(e.getName()) > 1)
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getName));
    }
```
These questions can be solved using Java streams and functional interfaces to manipulate the list of employees and collect the results into a `Map`.
