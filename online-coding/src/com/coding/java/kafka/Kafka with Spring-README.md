Creating 100 scenario-based interview questions for Kafka with Spring can be quite an extensive task, but here's a set of questions that covers various aspects of using Kafka with Spring:

1. **Scenario**: You are building a real-time analytics platform using Kafka and Spring. How would you design the data pipeline to ensure high throughput and low latency?
    - Question: What Kafka configurations would you adjust to optimize the performance of your data pipeline?

2. **Scenario**: Your team is implementing event sourcing with Kafka and Spring for a banking application. How would you ensure data consistency and reliability?
    - Question: How can Kafka transactional messaging be used to ensure exactly-once message processing in event sourcing?

3. **Scenario**: You are designing a microservices architecture where services communicate using Kafka topics. How would you handle service discovery and load balancing?
    - Question: Explain how you would implement service registration and discovery using Spring Cloud and Kafka.

4. **Scenario**: Your application uses Kafka Streams for real-time data processing. How would you handle state management and fault tolerance?
    - Question: Describe the role of Kafka Streams state stores and how they ensure fault tolerance in your application.

5. **Scenario**: You need to implement message partitioning in Kafka to achieve parallel processing. How would you decide the partitioning strategy?
    - Question: Discuss different partitioning strategies supported by Kafka and when each strategy is appropriate.

6. **Scenario**: You are building a notification service that sends messages to users based on certain events. How would you design this service using Kafka and Spring?
    - Question: Explain how you would use Kafka's consumer groups to ensure each user receives notifications exactly once.

7. **Scenario**: Your application uses Kafka Connect to import data from a MySQL database into Kafka topics. How would you ensure data integrity and consistency?
    - Question: Describe the role of Kafka Connect's converters and single message transformations in ensuring data integrity during data import.

8. **Scenario**: You are implementing a logging service that collects logs from multiple services and stores them in Kafka. How would you design this service for scalability and resilience?
    - Question: Discuss the benefits of using Kafka for log aggregation and how you would handle log retention and compaction.

9. **Scenario**: Your team is migrating an existing application to use Kafka for messaging. How would you plan the migration process to minimize downtime?
    - Question: Describe the steps involved in migrating an application from traditional messaging systems to Kafka.

10. **Scenario**: You are troubleshooting performance issues in a Kafka cluster. How would you identify bottlenecks and optimize the cluster configuration?
    - Question: Explain the tools and techniques you would use to monitor and diagnose performance issues in a Kafka cluster.

These questions should provide a good starting point for assessing a candidate's knowledge and experience with Kafka and Spring.
