Your code already demonstrates good use of object-oriented programming principles. However, there are a few enhancements you could consider to improve the design and maintainability of your code:

1. **Use of Interfaces:** Define an interface for `Ticket` and `Guest` to provide a common contract for all ticketing systems. This allows you to easily switch implementations or add new features in the future.

```java
interface Ticket {
    void addGuest(int index, int age);
    void setTotalCost(int totalCost);
    void displayTicketDetails();
    void displayTicketDetailsForSecurity();
}

interface Guest {
    int getAge();
    void setAge(int age);
}
```

2. **Use of Inheritance:** If you foresee different types of tickets with varying behavior, you can consider using inheritance. For example, you could have a `GroupTicket` class that extends `Ticket` to handle group discounts or special group-related features.

3. **Better Exception Handling:** Instead of just printing an error message for negative age values, consider throwing a more descriptive exception, like `IllegalArgumentException`, to indicate that an invalid age was provided.

4. **Separation of Concerns:** Consider moving the logic for calculating the total cost of a ticket into the `Ticket` class itself. This way, the `Ticket` class is responsible for its own calculation logic.

5. **Dependency Injection:** Instead of creating an instance of `TicketPriceCalculator` inside the `issueTicket` method, consider passing it as a parameter or injecting it into the `Ticket` constructor. This makes your code more flexible and testable.

6. **Input Validation:** Add input validation to ensure that the user enters valid values for the number of guests and guest ages. This helps prevent runtime errors and improves the user experience.

Overall, your code is already well-structured, but these enhancements can further improve its design and maintainability.
